## *WORK IN PROGRESS*

## Requirements
* PHP ^7.0 
* WordPress ^4.7

## Things to consider:
Composer is just used as a Packagist declaration. 
The plugin requirements for the backend is just WordPress from version 4.7.

Autoload will not be provided via Composer 
as the plugin will be published at the official WordPress plugin repository as downloadable plugin.

## Goal
Create a WordPress plugin for post list managing based on fun techniques as Bulma, Vue and WordPress API.
